# ``ColorWell/ColorWellView``

A SwiftUI view that displays a user-settable color value.

## Overview

Color wells enable custom color selection within an interface. For example, a drawing app might include a color well to let someone choose the color to use when drawing. Color wells display the currently selected color, and interactions with the color well display interfaces for selecting new colors.
